# reusable-workflows
Reusable Github Actions Workflow

Take note the default branch is now `v2` instead of `main`

`main` branch will be the v1 of reusable workflows.

All workflows defaults to `ubuntu-latest`

To use self hosted runners override the following labels:
- default_runner_override_label -> 'self-hosted'
- runner_label -> <your_custom_label>
